BSc Computer Science, University of Madras. Based in London, hybrid preferred, one month notice.

Day to day: Node, TypeScript, Postgres, Redis, a bit of Kafka for billing events. He is the person on his team who reviews anything touching money because he genuinely enjoys idempotency edge cases. Wrote Paddle's internal guide to safe retries. Less experienced with infrastructure - he can read Terraform but has always had a platform team.

Career goal is a senior title within eighteen months at a company where payments is the product rather than a cost centre. Bath-based, in London two days a week without complaint. Four weeks notice.

Led the build of a batch-messaging feature that went from discovery to national rollout in nine weeks and now sends 4m messages a month.

Earlier career at a Lagos fintech (two years, mobile money APIs) then an MSc at Edinburgh. That mix shows: she is pragmatic about shipping but rigorous where data sensitivity demands it, and she can explain FHIR resource modelling to a non-technical stakeholder without condescension.

Referred by a former Accurx colleague we placed last year, who called her "the engineer everyone quietly routes hard problems to".

Strengths: dimensional modelling that analysts actually enjoy using, dbt discipline (she introduced contract testing between models at Ocado), and a habit of sitting with downstream consumers before building anything.

He designed the store-and-forward layer that keeps trucks operational through cellular dead zones and reconciles cleanly on reconnect - a genuinely hard exactly-once problem he can discuss for an hour without notes.

Earlier: Spotify (playback infrastructure, two years) and a Stockholm consultancy. Strong system-design fundamentals with the practical scars to back them - he ran the incident response when a malformed firmware rollout tripled message volume overnight, and his post-mortem process became the company template.

    addedDays: 36,
    cv: `Fullstack engineer, eight years, seven of them in PHP/Laravel at a Cardiff digital agency - latterly as their most senior engineer, running builds for membership organisations and a sizeable e-learning platform (400k users, his architecture, still running well). For the last eighteen months he has been deliberately migrating his stack to TypeScript: a Next.js side project with real paying users (a rugby-club management tool, 60 clubs), Node services at work where he can smuggle them in, and a disciplined study habit he can evidence.

The agency-senior profile brings underrated strengths: client-facing communication, estimating, mentoring two juniors, and shipping within budgets. The gap is honest - his production TypeScript is lighter than his production PHP, and some teams will price him as mid on the new stack despite senior-level judgement. The right hire treats that as an arbitrage.

Welsh, Cardiff, remote-heavy preferred. Four weeks notice. Salary expectation £60–68k, pragmatic about the stack-switch discount. Loyal profile - one employer for seven years - and interviews as exactly what he is: solid, honest, ready.`,

Her craft is the unglamorous heart of data work - naming, testing, contracts, documentation - done to a standard that makes downstream analysts fast and confident.

Started as an analyst at a French retail group in Lille, moved to London and into analytics engineering as the discipline was being named. Python is workmanlike; her genius is in SQL and structure. She talks about data models the way good API designers talk about interfaces: consumers first, breaking changes as a last resort, deprecation with dignity.

French, settled status, London, hybrid fine. Eight weeks notice (Monzo standard). Referred by Sofia Marchetti from a dbt meetup. Wants a smaller company where she can set the standard rather than maintain one - a first-analytics-engineer role would suit her perfectly. Salary expectation £80–85k.`,

Beyond FinOps: standard modern estate ownership, EKS, GitHub Actions pipelines, Datadog, and a knack for the boring reliability work (backup restores actually tested, DNS actually documented) that only gets noticed when it is missing.

Career path is steady mid-market - a logistics firm, an agency, now martech - no glamour names, consistently strong references. He is the engineer who makes a platform sane rather than impressive, and he is at peace with that positioning.

British-Nigerian, Romford-based, hybrid fine, on-site-heavy also fine - he genuinely likes being in the room. One month notice. Salary expectation £78–85k. The Portside brief could have been written for him; flag the Felixstowe on-site pattern as a positive, not an apology.`,

Agency life made him fast, versatile and unflappable with stakeholders; he has scoped, built and handed over more production systems than most engineers see in a career.

The Monzo wealth work maps almost one-to-one onto our merchant dashboard problems, and the design-system ownership is a bonus we did not advertise for.

His WebSocket multiplexing war stories from IG are directly relevant to the streaming-balance work on our roadmap. Depth over breadth profile: he was honest that content-heavy or marketing-page work would bore him, so we should be honest back about how much dashboard versus general product work this role carries.

Noah took our micro-frontend question, challenged its premise politely, and then designed a federation model including the governance layer - versioning contracts, deprecation policy, the boring parts everyone else skips. What sold me completely was him walking through the over-federated first attempt at Lloyds and how he unwound it: he narrates his own failures with more insight than most candidates narrate their wins. Concern is purely fit-to-level - he may be bored unless we genuinely hand him the platform direction. Emphatic pass.`,

Nadia treats component APIs the way our backend folk treat service contracts - she talked about breaking changes, versioning and deprecation policy for a design system with real rigour, and her accessibility knowledge is the deepest I have personally interviewed. The ClearBank back-office years mean she understands reconciliation as an operation, not just a screen. Code exercise was clean, tested, and she narrated trade-offs unprompted. No technical reservations at all; the only question for the final round is scope and money, because she is currently well paid and knows her market. Strong pass.`,

The complication is entirely compensation: she is on £98k plus a real bonus and her number is £112k, which is £7k above the very top of band.

Katya crushed the algorithmic portion - cleanest virtualisation reasoning I have seen - but when we moved to open-ended discussion about performance in product terms she went quiet, gave fragments, and visibly lost confidence. Asked how she would explain a perf trade-off to a designer, she answered in big-O notation. For a senior role on a collaborative squad that is a real problem today, not a rounding error.

But every time I pushed on why a technical choice was made, the answer stopped at the surface: she could tell me what felt right, not what the constraints were, and when I asked how her prettiest project handled state at scale she conceded it never had to. Great collaborator energy, wrong seniority for a senior req that owns architecture. Would enthusiastically interview her again in two years, or tomorrow for a mid role on a craft-led team.

Tom is exactly the shape this role wants: the Paddle dunning and proration work is real money-handling experience, and his line that "every way a webhook can lie to you" turned into a genuinely useful five-minute taxonomy - he was not reciting, he was remembering. Motivation checks out too: he wants payments as the product rather than a cost centre, which is literally our pitch. Slightly light on infrastructure, self-declared, but we have platform coverage.

Viktor redesigned our transfer-state handling on the whiteboard, arrived independently at the outbox pattern we use, and then identified a schema-evolution gap that we genuinely have and have been quietly avoiding. His Wise experience is not adjacent to our problems, it is our problems. The known flag showed mildly: he enjoys being the smartest person in the room.

George sketched a partitioning and rebalancing scheme for our webhook fanout that is close to what our own payments spine does, except he got there in forty minutes from a cold start and included load numbers and failure domains without being asked - the instinct you cannot teach. Booking-scale read-path experience translates well even though his stack is JVM and ours is Node; he was refreshingly unbothered by the language question and talked in systems, not syntax. Communication plain and unshowy. Wants product visibility, and payments interests him explicitly. Definite pass; he is senior-plus in mid-role clothing, and we should discuss levelling before offer stage.`,

    feedback: `Oluwaseun made our hardest interview problem look routine. Exactly-once webhook processing, idempotency under retry storms, backpressure when a PSP goes slow - he answered in the calm, precise register of someone who has operated systems where mistakes cost real money in microseconds. His design instincts are exceptional: he budgeted latency and failure probability the way other candidates budget story points. The LMAX-to-payments motivation story holds up; he wants product context back and says so credibly. Softly spoken until the problem got hard, then a completely different energy. Strong yes.

The urgency note is the point of this write-up: he disclosed, entirely professionally, that he holds a verbal offer from a challenger bank with a deadline this Friday. He prefers our problem space and said the payments-as-product framing is why we are ahead, but he will not let a bird in hand expire for a maybe. We are not negotiating against ourselves on comp - his ask is inside band. We are negotiating against the calendar. Offer paperwork today, please.`,

    feedback: `Flawless, and my bar for this round is famously unkind. James sharded our ingest tier on the whiteboard, called out the failure modes before I could ask my prepared questions, and then - unprompted - talked through blast-radius containment and what he would deliberately not build in year one. The Cloudflare config-propagation work is the closest external analogue to our pipeline that exists. He interviews like a peer reviewing a design doc, which is precisely the staff behaviour we are hiring for. I have no technical reservations whatsoever. Get him in front of the founders before someone else's final round does.`,

    feedback: `Final confirmed what the design round promised, and the founders felt it too. Two material notes for the offer conversation. First, he is at final stage in two other processes and one is a household-name platform team with a comp ceiling we cannot match in cash - our route is equity and scope, and he engaged seriously with both, asking sharper questions about the cap table than most investors do. Second, he was candid that architecture ownership is the decision criterion: if the role is a tech-lead-in-disguise he walks. It is not, and I told him so in writing. Move fast; strong hire.`,

    feedback: `Stefan thinks in systems the way the best platform people do - control plane versus data plane, paved roads with escape hatches, golden paths priced by the friction they remove. His Zalando bootstrap-time story (three days to forty minutes) survived hostile questioning: he knew the before-and-after numbers, the migration sequencing, and what he would do differently. What impressed me most was the texture of his honesty - twice he said "I don't know, here is how I would find out" without a flicker of discomfort, and both answers were good. Wants smaller scale on purpose. He and James O'Donnell are genuinely different flavours of excellent; lucky problem to have. Pass.`,

    feedback: `Not at the level for this role, and it was clear early. Peter's answers name-checked the right tools - Terraform modules, EKS upgrades, GitLab pipelines - but every time I pushed one layer down the response went hand-wavy: asked why he would choose a pattern he described, he restated the pattern in vendor vocabulary rather than reasoning from first principles. Asked to design from a blank page, he reached for what his current employer does and could not defend it. To be fair to him, he executes established patterns competently and would be a fine engineer inside a larger platform org. That is a different job from this one. No.`,

Daniel is the first candidate for this role who lit up rather than winced when I described the 2009 ERP that will outlive us all - his fourteen-month coexistence migration story matched our situation almost embarrassingly closely, zero unplanned downtime, and he could name the boring controls that made it true. Azure depth is real, Terraform discipline evident, and his alert-hygiene line ("an alert nobody acts on is a bug") is going on the office wall. Sponsorship is required but he arrived with the Skilled Worker process already researched, which tells you about the man. Confirmed he is fine with Felixstowe Tuesdays and Thursdays. Pass, and my preferred candidate so far.`,

    feedback: `Ade is the one. The £900k AWS savings story checked out in detail - he walked me through the tagging discipline that made it measurable, which is exactly the unglamorous rigour this estate needs, and he genuinely likes being on site, which puts him in a minority of one among our shortlist. The wrinkle is money: he is expecting £85k and our band stops at £78k. I think he is worth the difference and cheaper than a second bad hire, but I cannot break the band without the FD's signature. Recommend we request the exception this week; if it is refused, offer at top of band plus the training budget and let me make the case to him personally.`,

Rashid's CV credentials are obviously real, but the interview never found its footing: asked to walk through a major incident, he circled through context for eight minutes without reaching the decision points, and when I tried to structure it for him he restarted the story rather than answering the question. It may partly be nerves and partly a mismatch - he operates at bank-scale process and we need someone hands-on across a small messy estate. Communication matters here because our engineers double as the help desk on bad days. Not right for Portside; I suspect he shines somewhere with more ceremony.`,

Sofia's Redshift-to-lakehouse migration story had the two qualities I always probe for: real numbers (two months early, forty percent under compute budget) and real regret (she would sequence the dbt contract-testing earlier next time - the fact she introduced contract testing at all puts her ahead of the field). She asked sharper information-governance questions than some of our own staff, unprompted, and her instinct to sit with downstream consumers before building matches how our clinical analysts actually work. Streaming depth is limited, self-declared, but our roadmap is batch-first for a year. Advance to final with Naomi.`,

Given the FHIR ingestion problem, he proposed a streaming backfill architecture with a clean separation of the hot path from the cold - the exact shape I have been failing to get funded - and then, unprompted, addressed schema-registry governance so trusts cannot break each other's feeds, which is our actual recurring incident. His exactly-once reasoning was rigorous without being showy, and he translated everything into clinical-consequence terms for the non-engineers in the room. That translation instinct is rare and this company runs on it. Emphatic pass; pair his final round with Naomi.`,

I want to appoint. Two hesitations for the record, both about compensation: her stated expectation has moved from £88k at screen to £95k now, and she has asked for a salary review commitment at six months. Neither is unreasonable given NHS-to-market adjustment, but the band is £90–105k and finance will want the six-month clause struck or capped. Resolve this quickly; she is referred and networked and will not stay available.`,

Ingrid's Babylon-era model-governance experience is exactly what our clinical-safety casework needs - she has run model cards, drift monitoring and an actually-exercised rollback under review conditions, which almost nobody in this market has done for real. Her judgement is the differentiator: her line that "a logistic regression beat the transformer and shipped in a week" is the sensibility I want setting precedent here. She was honest that the consultancy year bored her; the mission fit with us is obvious and mutual. Offer approved at panel, references waived to verbal given the referrer. Delighted with this one.`,

Hannah brought actual experiment write-ups - including the failures, which is the tell I look for - and her Gousto skip-versus-cancel work is the closest analogue to our subscription-pause problem that exists in the UK market. She pulls her own cohorts in SQL, so she will not be blocked by our tiny data team, and she handled the brand-team scenario question with more warmth than most growth people can fake. Honest that pure acquisition bores her; fine, that is not this role. She would raise our experiment discipline overnight. Advance, and let us not dawdle - she reads like someone with options.`,

Charlotte is impressively polished - the GoCardless pricing-and-packaging story is disciplined, co-credited honestly, and her customer-discovery cadence is the most rigorous on this shortlist. But it is all B2B: buyer-versus-user dynamics, procurement cycles, dashboard products. Asked about consumer repeat-purchase mechanics she reasoned intelligently from first principles, which is promising but not the same as having done it, and she said as much herself before I could. I want a consumer-shaped case exercise before deciding either way. If she converts that round, her rigour might beat the specialists.`,

Tessa has a superb regulatory brain - her explanation of clinical-safety casework versus ordinary product decisions was genuinely fascinating - but this is a growth job at a food-and-lifestyle brand and the conversation kept sliding back to institutional buyers and evidence frameworks. Twice I asked about funnel instincts and got governance answers; she was talking past the question rather than to it. I do not think she actually wants this job so much as a job, and hiring a brilliant person into the wrong seat helps nobody. If we ever build a regulated wellness line, call her first.

Amara's nine-weeks-to-national-rollout story survived my usual interrogation - she could name the corners cut, the ones deliberately not cut, and the monitoring she added before scale-up, which is the shipped-under-pressure texture I hire for. Range is real: schema design through React without a seam. The healthtech IG discipline translates surprisingly well to our rights-management constraints around footage. She asked better questions about our match-day traffic spikes than the last SRE candidate did. No reservations; get her to final before her other processes wake up. Pass.`,

The commercial picture is the reason for this note: she has a scale-up offer in hand expiring at the end of next week and her agency-side contacts have floated a counter to keep her, though her startup's runway anxiety is clearly the true motivator and stability is our best card to play.

What sold me on Tunde was the combination I described in panel as boring-systems discipline plus startup recency - seven years of insurer-grade care about data integrity, then a genuine two-year retooling into TypeScript that finished with him rebuilding a quoting portal solo. He asked about support rotas before we could ask him about ambition, which told me everything about how he ships. Not the flashiest candidate on the shortlist; comfortably the one I trust most with our billing integration. Offer accepted at band midpoint. Onboarding him with the rights-renewal project first.`,

He asked for our message-volume numbers before proposing anything, which already puts him ahead of most seniors, and his consensus trade-off discussion was the best I have heard in this process. The Einride telemetry work is our problem domain wearing a different logo. Understated in manner; do not mistake it, the depth is exceptional. Hire before our competitors meet him. The climate motivation is genuine, which helps our comp position but should not be leaned on.`,

Clear pass on ability. The flag for the offer stage is compensation: his expectation is £110–120k, which is the very top of our band before we discuss his Rust ambitions, and he knows precisely what he is worth. He signalled flexibility for genuinely hard problems, and ours qualify. We should decide our ceiling before the final rather than discovering it live.

Yuki's Python craft is genuinely good - the zero-downtime migration playbook he described is careful, tested work - but this is a Go role in a heavily relational, high-concurrency domain and the gaps showed: his schema-design answers stayed at marketplace-CRUD depth, and concurrency questions got textbook rather than experienced responses. He was upfront that Mercari's platform team abstracted the hard distribution problems away, which I respect but cannot hire around here. The sponsorship lead time compounds the case against. Would happily see him again for a Python-first product role; he is better than this result suggests.`,

Mei-Ling talks about Core Web Vitals with revenue numbers attached - her ASOS image-loading work moved conversion 1.9% and she knew the confidence interval, which is not a sentence I get to write often. The agency Shopify years mean she has genuine sympathy for content editors, and she asked about our editorial workflow before asking about the stack, which is exactly the instinct this storefront needs. Playwright discipline strong, design collaboration style thoughtful (intent before pixels). Salary expectation fits comfortably.

    feedback: `Yes from me, and an easy one. Roisin has shipped through four peak trading seasons without a conversion-impacting incident, and when I pressed for the closest call she gave an honest, specific answer about a Black Friday cache stampede rather than a rehearsed humility line. The Vue-to-React conversion story shows real learning depth, and her wanting a smaller, kinder team after THG is a fit we can actually deliver rather than a promise we would be stretching. Slightly understated in person; her code samples carry the confidence her presentation undersells. Offer at the number discussed - she has earned the top of the range we floated.`,

Freya has actually sold things to actual people - seven Christmases on a shop floor - and it shows in how she thinks about stock states, customer patience and what a product page is for. The code is junior and she knows it; the learning velocity is not junior at all, and her rota-tool side project had real users and real bug reports she fixed at 6am before shifts.

    feedback: `The panel was won over, including the sceptics. Kirsten's strangler-migration story at Babbel is nearly a rehearsal for our Django-to-services transition - she could name the sequencing, the metrics that told her it was working, and the quarter she deliberately paused it to ship product, which reassured our commercial director more than any architecture slide. Management philosophy is structured and humane; the zero-regretted-attrition claim came with names and context rather than as a slogan. Still technical enough to review designs credibly and honest about being eighteen months from production code. Clinical stakeholders responded well to her directness.

His incident walkthroughs are textbook: structure, decision points, what changed afterwards. He was straightforward about the shape of his skills - deep on the watching, lighter on databases - which maps fine onto this role given where our pain actually is. Remote-heavy needs are compatible with our setup. Pass; Ana should probe capacity-planning depth at final, the one area I could not fully test.`,

Rashid held the room through a live incident simulation with the calm of someone who has run real bridge calls when the stakes were measured in headlines - his triage structure was clean, his delegation instincts genuine, and his error-budget-policy experience is a governance maturity we frankly lack. The banking-estate legacy shows in places (some tooling instincts a generation behind) but he named the gap himself and his homelab evidence of closing it was oddly persuasive. He wants reliability work that ships in days, not committee quarters, and that is exactly what we sell. Offer recommended at the discussed number.`,

The payments-integration depth is genuine - her webhook-delivery war stories and the "webhooks are a distributed-systems problem" framing are exactly the scar tissue our rent-collection pipeline needs, and her Open Banking mandate-flow knowledge would shortcut months of our roadmap. The hesitation: her testing answers leaned on the harness she built rather than on strategy - asked how she would test a flow without her tooling, the answer thinned out noticeably. Might be framing, might be a gap. Nikki runs a second session next week focused there. Comp expectation fits the band, which matters here.`,

Chloe's take-home was the cleanest submission of the whole process - small commits, honest README caveats, a test suite that tested behaviour rather than implementation - and in the pairing session she took correction once and never needed it repeated, which is the most coachable performance I have interviewed. The apprenticeship-over-university decision came with an articulate defence and zero chip on the shoulder. Offer at the top of the junior band, accepted.
